Is there weather at Rocky Mountain National Park?
=================================================

A request that checks one of the [RMNP webcams](https://www.nps.gov/romo/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm) (Longs Peak, Continental Divide or Alpine Visitors Center) for blue skies. 



Tests for expected behavior:

Really should be a bot to post notifications of weather. Ideally if there's weather late afternoon/sunset.
